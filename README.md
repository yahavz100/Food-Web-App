# FoodWebApp
As part of Workshop in Databases course at Bar Ilan University, we developed a user application that extracts data, analyzes it and makes creative use of it.
The main focus is on large online databases (knowledge bases), therefore the application is based on Flask and SQL (using mySQL) and developed by MVC architecture.
